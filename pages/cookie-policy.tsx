          <h2 className="font-semibold ">What are cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, More Media
            International Ltd UK) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set
            by parties other than the website owner are called "third party
            cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or
            functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like
            advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that
            set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when
            it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
            other websites.
          </p>
          <p>Why do we use cookies?</p>
          <p>
            We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
            cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites
            to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
            necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target
            the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
            Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for
            advertising, analytics and other purposes.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-semibold">How can I control cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
            You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in
            the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
            select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
            cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
            you with services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner
            and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still
            use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
            of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web
            browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which
            you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
            browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for
            more information.
